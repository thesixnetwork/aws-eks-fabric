# Hyperledger Fabric on Kubernetes - Part 4: Fabric workshop - creating remote peers

## The Workshop
This workshop builds remote Hyperledger Fabric peers in other AWS accounts/regions, connects them to the Fabric orderer 
organisation, installs the 'marbles' chaincode, and allows workshop participants to have fun swapping marbles. Each workshop 
participant will run their own Fabric peer in their own AWS account, and see the Fabric state via a local Node.js application 
that connects to their own local peer and reads their own local copy of the ledger.

The workshop gives participants the experience of building their own Kubernetes cluster before running a Fabric CA and
Fabric peers as pods in Kubernetes. Once the peer is running, the participants will follow the steps to connect it to a
channel, install chaincode, test the channel connection, then run a Node.js application that connects to the peer node
and displays the peers ledger state in a colourful UI.

## The Architecture
![Marbles Workshop Architecture](../architecture/WorkshopRemotePeer.png "Marbles Workshop Architecture")

* You will interact with Hyperledger Fabric using the Marbles application, which is a Node.js application that you will
run locally (or in Cloud9). During this workshop you will configure and run this application.
* The Marbles application will connect to a Fabric peer running in your own AWS account, in any region you choose. During
this workshop you will configure and run the Fabric peer.
* The Marbles application also connects to an Orderer service, which orders the transactions and groups them into blocks.
* The Orderer service will run in the facilitators AWS account, in a region he/she chooses.

This represents a typical Hyperledger network, where the Orderer is owned either by a joint-venture, a consortium or some other
legal entity, and each member of the network runs their peers independently, connected to the Orderer.

## Workshop pre-requisites
The pre-requisites are as follows:

* An AWS account where you can create a Kubernetes cluster (either your own Kubernetes cluster or EKS)
* It's preferable that you have some basic Kubernetes experience

You have a choice to run this workshop either on your own laptop or on a Cloud9 instance. I recommend using the Cloud9
instance as it comes pre-installed with most of the packages we need, plus it also has the AWS CLI already installed. If
you have a Windows laptop I'd strongly recommend using Cloud9 as this workshop has not been tested on a Windows machine.

If you choose to run the workshop from your laptop, you'll need to install the following:

* AWS CLI with the appropriate AWS API credentials pointing to the AWS account and region where you will deploy Kubernetes. You can use 
an [~/.aws/credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-config-files.html) 
or [environment variables](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html). For more information 
read the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-environment.html).
* Git installed locally. See https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Mac
You'll need to have Node.js installed. You'll need a version > 6.10.1, but it must be 6.x.x. 
See https://nodejs.org/en/download/. If you have a different version, you can either use `nvm` to use a specific version
or uninstall it (on Mac), and install the correct version using homebrew. 

```bash
brew uninstall node --force
brew install node@6
```

Then do:

```bash
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/node@6/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Check the node version:

```bash
$ node -v
v6.14.3
$ npm -v
3.10.10
```

* npm installed. It should have been installed together with node in the step above. If not, see https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm


### Cloud9

After completing Step 1 below, make sure Cloud9 has the correct version of Node.js installed. Check the version:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You'll need a version > 6.10.1, but it must be 6.x.x. 

## Getting Started
 
### Step 1: Create a Kubernetes cluster
You need an EKS cluster to start. The easiest way to do this is to create an EKS cluster using the eksctl tool. In the same 
VPC as EKS you'll also need an EFS drive (for the Fabric cryptographic material) and an EC2 bastion host, which you'll
use to create and manage the Fabric network. Open the [EKS Readme](../eks/README.md) in this repo and follow the instructions. 
Once you are complete come back to this README.

### Step 2: Get the Fabric crypto information
Before creating your Fabric peer you'll need the certificate and key information for the organisation the peer belongs
to. The steps below are a quick and dirty way of obtaining this info - not recommended for production use, but it will
save us plenty of time fiddling around with keys, certificates and certificate authorities. 

A quick method of setting up a remote peer for an existing org involves copying the existing crypto material. We've made
this information available in an S3 bucket - you just need to download it and copy it to your EFS as follows:

* SSH into the EC2 bastion you created in Step 1
* Download the crypto information:

```bash
cd
curl https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/mcdg-blockchain-workshop/opt.tar -o opt.tar
ls -l
```

* Extract the crypto material (you may need to use 'sudo'. Ignore the 'permission denied' error message, if you receive one):

```bash
cd /
rm -rf /opt/share
tar xvf ~/opt.tar 
ls -lR /opt/share
```

You should see something like this (though this is only a subset):

```bash
$ ls -lR /opt/share
/opt/share:

.
.
.
```

### Step 3: Edit env.sh
We've reached the final step before we get our hands on Hyperledger Fabric. In this step we prepare the configuration
file used by the scripts that configure Fabric.

* SSH into the EC2 bastion you created in Step 1
* Navigate to the `hyperledger-on-kubernetes` repo

```bash
cd
cd hyperledger-on-kubernetes
vi remote-peer/scripts/env-remote-peer.sh
```

* Edit the file `remote-peer/scripts/env-remote-peer.sh`. Update PEER_PREFIX to any name you choose. This will become 
the name of your peer on the network. Try to make this unique within the network - your alias would work. Example: PEER_PREFIX="michaelpeer"
* Don't change anything else.

TIP: You'll be using the peer prefix you set above in many places. It will make your life easier
if you do a search/replace in this README, replacing all 'michaelpeer' with your prefix. That way you can copy/paste 
the commands I provide below instead of having to edit them.

### Step 4: Register Fabric identities with the Fabric certificate authority
Before we can start our Fabric peer we must register it with the Fabric certificate authority (CA). All participants in 
a Fabric network have identities (Fabric is a private, permissioned blockchain network), and these identities are created
by a CA. This step will start Fabric CA and register our peer:

```bash
cd
cd hyperledger-on-kubernetes
./workshop-remote-peer/start-remote-fabric-setup.sh
```

Now let's investigate the results of the previous script:

```bash
kubectl get po -n org1 
```

You should see something similar to this. It shows us that so far, in Kubernetes, we have started a root CA (rca), 
an intermediate CA (ica), and a pod that registers peers identities (register-p).

```bash
$ kubectl get po -n org1
NAME                               READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
ica-notls-org1-66f96667c5-ftswd    1/1       Running   0          45s
ica-org1-5694787654-g5j9l          1/1       Running   0          53s
rca-org1-6c769cc569-5cfqb          1/1       Running   0          1m
register-p-org1-66bd5688b4-fhzmh   1/1       Running   0          28s
```

Look at the logs for the register pod. Replace the pod name with your own pod name, the one returned above by 'kubectl get po -n org1 ':

```bash
kubectl logs register-p-org1-66bd5688b4-fhzmh -n org1
```

You'll see something like this (edited for brevity), as the CA admin is enrolled with the intermediate CA, then the
peer user (in this case 'michaelpeer1-org1') is registered with the CA:

```bash
$ kubectl logs register-p-org1-66bd5688b4-fhzmh -n org1

```

### Step 5: Start the peer
We are now ready to start the new peer. The peer runs as a pod in Kubernetes. Let's take a look at the pod spec before
we deploy it. In the statement below, replace 'michaelpeer1' with the name of your peer. If you 
are unsure, you can simply do 'ls k8s' to view the yaml files that were generated based on your selections, and find
the file start starts with 'fabric-deployment-workshop-remote-peer-'.

```bash
more k8s/fabric-deployment-workshop-remote-peer-michaelpeer1-org1.yaml
```

There are a few things of interest in the pod yaml file:

* The pod specifies 2 containers: couchdb, a key-value store which stores the Fabric world state, and the peer itself
* The peer is bootstrapped using a script, which you can view by opening 'scripts/start-peer.sh'
* The peer is exposed using a Kubernetes service

So let's deploy the peer and check the logs. You may need to wait 30 seconds before 'kubectl logs' will return the log
entries, as Kubernetes downloads and starts your container:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/fabric-deployment-workshop-remote-peer-michaelpeer1-org1.yaml
kubectl logs deploy/michaelpeer1-org1 -n org1 -c michaelpeer1-org1
```

You'll see a large number of log entries, which you are free to look at. The most important entries are a few
lines from the end of the log file. Look for these, and make sure there are no errors after these lines:

```bash
2018-07-22 03:05:49.145 UTC [nodeCmd] serve -> INFO 1ca Starting peer with ID=[name:"michaelpeer1-org1" ], network ID=[dev], address=[100.96.2.149:7051]
2018-07-22 03:05:49.146 UTC [nodeCmd] serve -> INFO 1cb Started peer with ID=[name:"michaelpeer1-org1" ], network ID=[dev], address=[100.96.2.149:7051]
```

If you can't find the entries, try grep:

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/michaelpeer1-org1 -n org1 -c michaelpeer1-org1 | grep 'Started peer'
```

Your peer has started, but..... it's useless at this point. It hasn't joined any channels, it can't run chaincode
and it does not maintain any ledger state. To start building a ledger on the peer we need to join a channel.

### Step 6: Join the peer to a channel
To give you a better understanding of Fabric, we are going to carry out the steps to join a peer to a channel manually.
We need to carry out the steps from within a container running in the Kubernetes cluster. We'll use the 'register'
container you started in step 4, as this runs the fabric-tools image, which will provide us a CLI (command line interface)
to interact with the peer. You can confirm this by:

```bash
kubectl get po -n org1
```

Then describe the register pod using the pod name (replace the pod name below with your own):

```bash
kubectl describe po register-p-org1-66bd5688b4-rrpw6 -n org1
```

Look at the Image Id attribute. You'll see it contains something like the entry below. fabric-tools provides a CLI
we can use to interact with a Fabric network:

```bash
docker-pullable://hyperledger/fabric-tools@sha256:e4dfa9b12a854e3fb691fece50e4a52744bc584af809ea379d27c4e035cbf008
```

OK, so let's 'exec' into the register container (replace the pod name below with your own):

```bash
kubectl exec -it register-p-org1-66bd5688b4-rrpw6 -n org1 bash
```

Now that you are inside the container, type the following:

```bash
peer
```

This will show you the help message for the Fabric 'peer' CLI. We'll use this to join a channel, install chaincode
and invoke transactions.

Firstly, we need to join a channel. To join a channel you'll need to be an admin user, and you'll need access to the 
channel genesis block. The channel genesis block is stored on the EFS drive, and you can see it by typing:

```bash
ls -l /data
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
# ls -l /data

```

Look for the file titled `mychannel.block`. The channel genesis block provides the configuration for the channel. It's the 
first block added to a channel, and forms 'block 0' in the Fabric blockchain for that channel. As a matter of interest,
Fabric supports multiple blockchains within the same Fabric network, each blockchain associated with a Fabric channel.

Interacting with peers using the 'peer' utility requires you to set ENV variables that provide context to the 'peer' utility.
We'll use the following ENV variables to indicate which peer we want to interact with. You'll need to make the following changes:

* Change 'michaelpeer' to match the name of your peer

You should still be inside the register container at this point. Copy all the variables below, and paste them into your 
terminal window. If you exit the register container, and 'exec' back in later, remember to rerun these export statements.

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false
export CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=false
export CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052
export CORE_PEER_ID=michaelpeer1-org1
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=michaelpeer1-org1.org1:7051
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```

Let's check to see whether the peer we specified in the export statement above has joined any channels:

```bash
peer channel list
```

You should see the following: 

```bash
# peer channel list
2018-07-26 03:40:45.128 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized
Channels peers has joined:
2018-07-26 03:40:45.133 UTC [main] main -> INFO 002 Exiting.....
```

Now let's join a channel. The statement below joins the peer you specified in the ENV variables above, with the channel
defined in mychannel.block. The channel name is, conveniently, 'mychannel':

```bash
peer channel join -b /data/mychannel.block
peer channel list
```

```bash
# peer channel join -b /data/mychannel.block
2018-07-26 03:42:26.352 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized
2018-07-26 03:42:26.493 UTC [channelCmd] executeJoin -> INFO 002 Successfully submitted proposal to join channel
2018-07-26 03:42:26.493 UTC [main] main -> INFO 003 Exiting.....
# peer channel list
2018-07-26 03:42:30.940 UTC [channelCmd] InitCmdFactory -> INFO 001 Endorser and orderer connections initialized
Channels peers has joined:
mychannel
2018-07-26 03:42:30.944 UTC [main] main -> INFO 002 Exiting.....
```

You should see that your peer has now joined the channel. 

### Step 7: Confirm peer has joined channel
To confirm the peer has joined the channel you'll need to check the peer logs. If there are existing blocks on the channel 
you should see them replicating to the new peer. Look for messages in the log file such as `Channel [mychannel]: Committing block [14385] to storage` -
you can find these by doing a search in your terminal window, or using grep.
To view the peer logs, exit the 'register' container (by typing 'exit' on the command line). This will return you to 
your EC2 bastion instance. Then enter (replacing the name of the peer with your own):

```bash
kubectl logs deploy/michaelpeer1-org1 -n org1 -c michaelpeer1-org1
```

### Step 8: Install the marbles chaincode
To install the marbles chaincode we'll first clone the chaincode repo to our 'register' container, then install the
chaincode to the peer. 'exec' back in to the 'register' container, rerun the export statements from Step 6 (replicated
below for convenience), and do the following:

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false
export CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=false
export CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052
export CORE_PEER_ID=michaelpeer1-org1
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=michaelpeer1-org1.org1:7051
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```


```bash
mkdir -p /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger
cd /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger
git clone https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles.git
cd marbles
mkdir /opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
```

Now install the chaincode:

```bash
peer chaincode install -n marbles-workshop -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/marbles/chaincode/src/marbles
```

The result should be similar to the one below. If it failed, make sure you run the export statements from Step 6:

```bash
# peer chaincode install -n marbles-workshop -v 1.0 -p github.com/hyperledger/marbles/chaincode/src/marbles
2018-07-26 08:57:55.684 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 001 Using default escc
2018-07-26 08:57:55.684 UTC [chaincodeCmd] checkChaincodeCmdParams -> INFO 002 Using default vscc
2018-07-26 08:57:55.823 UTC [main] main -> INFO 003 Exiting.....
```

Check that it was installed. We also check if it was instantiated. It should be as it was instantiated by the facilitator
when the channel was setup:

```bash
peer chaincode list --installed
peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel
```

You should see the following. You may need to try the 'instantiated' command more than once:

```bash
# peer chaincode list --installed
Get installed chaincodes on peer:
Name: marbles-workshop, Version: 1.0, Path: github.com/hyperledger/marbles/chaincode/src/marbles, Id: 7c07640a582822f8bb2364fa0ab0d204ba8b3d6b28f559027fcbdccfe65b3aae
2018-08-25 02:05:08.338 UTC [main] main -> INFO 001 Exiting.....
root@register-p-org1-665687bcb4-qk9np:/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/marbles# peer chaincode list --instantiated -C mychannel

2018-08-25 02:05:08.426 UTC [main] main -> INFO 001 Exiting.....
```

### Step 9: Creating a user
So far we have interacted with the peer node using the Admin user. This might not have been apparent, but the export 
statements we used include the following line, 'export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp', which
sets the MSP (membership service provider) context to an admin user. Admin was used to join the channel and install the chaincode,
but to invoke transactions and query the ledger state we need a user. Users are created by fabric-ca, a tool provided for 
us by Fabric to act as a root CA and manage the registration and enrollment of identities.

Once again, 'exec' into the register container.
 
Run the export statements from Step 6 (replicated below for convenience). Then execute the statements below.

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false
export CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=false
export CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052
export CORE_PEER_ID=michaelpeer1-org1
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=michaelpeer1-org1.org1:7051
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```

```bash
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/org1/user
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=$FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_HOME/msp
export FABRIC_CA_CLIENT_TLS_CERTFILES=/data/org1-ca-chain.pem
fabric-ca-client enroll -d -u https://marbles-org1:marbles-org1pw@ica-org1.org1:7054
```

You'll see a lengthy response that looks similar to this. Make sure you receive a 'statusCode=201' to indicate you user
was created successfully:

```bash

Some final copying of certs is required:

cp /data/orgs/org1/admin/msp/signcerts/* /etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/org1/user/msp/admincerts
```

From now on, the following export statement will identify you as a user:

```bash
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/org1/user/msp
```

as the following export statement will identity you as an admin:

```bash
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```

### Step 10: Invoke transactions in Fabric
Let's run a query. In Fabric, a query will execute on the peer node and query the world state, which is the current
state of the ledger. World state is stored in either a CouchDB or LevelDB key-value store. The query below will
return the latest marble owners. 

When we say 'run a query', we really mean 'execute chaincode that queries the world state'. In Fabric, chaincode executes
inside a Docker container. The first time you run chaincode it may take around 30 seconds as the Docker container that hosts 
the chaincode is downloaded and created.

Rerun the export statements from Step 6 (replicated below for convenience):

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false
export CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=false
export CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052
export CORE_PEER_ID=michaelpeer1-org1
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=michaelpeer1-org1.org1:7051
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```

```bash
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/org1/user/msp
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}' 
```

```bash
# peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}'

```

Invoking a transaction is different to running a query. Whereas a query runs locally on your own peer, a transaction
first runs locally, simulating the transaction against your local world state, then the results are sent to the 
orderer. The orderer groups the transactions into blocks and distributes them to all peer nodes. All the peers
then update their ledgers and world state with each transaction in the block.

Since the transaction is sent to the orderer, you need to provide the orderer endpoint when invoking a transaction. The 
orderer DNS below is correct - it was updated by the facilitator prior to this workshop:

```bash
export ORDERER_CONN_ARGS="-o ae1c0be5ee31111e8bc5e06d80436fb8-e2d2261530926342.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:7050"
peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["set_owner","m999999999990","o9999999999999999990", "United Marbles"]}' $ORDERER_CONN_ARGS
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}' 
```

### Step 11: Connect an application to your Fabric peer
We are going to connect the marbles client application to your peer node. This will provide you with a user interface
you can use to interact with the Fabric network. It will also provide you visibility into what is happening in the
network, and what activities are being carried out by the other workshop participants.

The Marbles client application uses the Fabric SDK and requires connectivity to three Fabric components:

* Orderer: the Orderer was created by the facilitator before the workshop started. The facilitator will provide the endpoint 
(in fact, it should have been provided for you in Step 10, and the facilitator should have updated this README with the correct
endpoint. See the statement 'export ORDERER_CONN_ARGS=')
* Peer: this is the peer you started in step 5. We will expose this using an NLB below (NLB because peers communicate using gRPC)
* CA: this is the CA you started in step 4. We will expose this using an ELB below (ELB because the CA server exposes a REST API)

Before we continue, there is a bug in EKS that requires us to edit an IAM policy. A missing permission in an EKS role
currently prevents the creation of load balancers, so we will edit the EKS role manually and add the permission.

In the IAM Console, in the AWS account containing your EKS cluster, find the role starting with `EKS-eks-fabric-ServiceRol-AWS`,
or `eksctl-eks-fabric-cluster-ServiceRole`, depending on whether you used eksctl to create your EKS cluster. In
my account this is `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/eksctl-eks-fabric-cluster-ServiceRole-I70T2EI24KWN`. In the Permissions 
tab, find the policy titled `eksctl-eks-fabric-cluster-PolicyNLB` (or similar). Select JSON, then Edit Policy. 
Add this permission to the policy: "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole". Make sure to use the same indents, and include a comma if
necessary. Review and save the policy.

Let's create the AWS Network Load Balancer (NLB) endpoints for the peer and the ca. The K8s YAML files to create these would 
have been generated for you. On your EC2 bastion instance (make sure you're on the EC2 instance, and not 'exec'd into the register
container) replace the org numbers below to match yours, and the name of the peer (i.e. michaelpeer) to match your own. 
These files should already exist in the k8s/ directory:

```bash
cd
cd hyperledger-on-kubernetes
kubectl apply -f k8s/fabric-nlb-notls-ca-org1.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/fabric-nlb-workshop-remote-peer-michaelpeer1-org1.yaml
```

Check whether the service endpoints were created. You should see the start of a DNS endpoint in the EXTERNAL-IP column. If
you see <pending>, rerun the 'get svc' command until you see the DNS name.

```bash
$ kubectl get svc -n org1
NAME                    TYPE           CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP        PORT(S)                         AGE
ica-notls-org1          NodePort       10.100.5.225     <none>             7054:30822/TCP                  1d
ica-notls-org1-nlb      LoadBalancer   10.100.186.98    a6a8a76dd9dec...   7054:30874/TCP                  1d
ica-org1                NodePort       10.100.17.167    <none>             7054:30821/TCP                  1d
michaelpeer1-org1       NodePort       10.100.104.218   <none>             7051:30751/TCP,7052:30752/TCP   1d
michaelpeer1-org1-nlb   LoadBalancer   10.100.103.133   a6abb6a419dec...   7051:32703/TCP                  1d
rca-org1                NodePort       10.100.34.72     <none>             7054:30800/TCP                  1d
```

You can see the full endpoint using `kubectl describe`, as follows. The 'LoadBalancer Ingress' attribute shows the AWS DNS representing
the ELB endpoint for the intermediate CA, ica-org1:

```bash
$ kubectl describe svc ica-notls-org1-nlb -n org1
Name:                     ica-notls-org1-nlb
Namespace:                org1
Labels:                   <none>
Annotations:              kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration={"apiVersion":"v1","kind":"Service","metadata":{"annotations":{"service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type":"nlb"},"name":"ica-notls-org1-nlb","...
                          service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-type=nlbSelector:                 app=hyperledger,name=ica-notls-org1,org=org1,role=ca
Type:                     LoadBalancer
IP:                       10.100.186.98
LoadBalancer Ingress:     a6a8a76dd9dec11e8916b0ad49a0d9da-a9d5addb53cfe772.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com
Port:                     endpoint  7054/TCP
TargetPort:               7054/TCP
NodePort:                 endpoint  30874/TCP
Endpoints:                192.168.229.65:7054
Session Affinity:         None
External Traffic Policy:  Cluster
Events:                   <none>
```

Do the same to view the NLB endpoint for the peer. Note down the LoadBalancer Ingress for both CA and peer. You'll use
them in Step 12.

In the next step we'll configure Marbles to use these endpoints, and connect the application to the Fabric network.

### Step 12: Preparing the Marbles application
To start, let's clone the Marbles application to your laptop or Cloud9 instance. Makes sure you are on your laptop or 
Cloud9 environment (whichever one you have used for the earlier parts of this workshop), and not SSH'd into the EC2 bastion:

```bash
cd
git clone https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles.git
cd marbles
```

Before building, make sure you have a version of node and npm, as specified in the prerequisites at
the top of this readme.

Prepare the app. You'll need npm (node package manager) for this so make sure you have it installed. See prerequisites at
the top of this readme. You may need to use 'sudo' for the 'npm install gulp -g'. Do not use 'sudo' for the main 'npm install':

```bash
npm install gulp -g
```

If the above command fails, you may need to use 'sudo'. I found this command always works on Cloud9, but on Mac 'sudo' may
be necessary. Also double check you are definitely on the EC2 bastion instance, and not 'exec'd into a container:

```bash
sudo npm install gulp -g
```

Then do:

```bash
npm install
```

To configure the connectivity between the Marbles app and the Fabric network, Marbles requires a connection profile that 
contains the connectivity endpoints. I have provided a template of this file for you in the hyperledger-on-kubernetes repo. Use cURL 
to download the files you'll need. If using the cURL method, make sure you are in the marbles directory, in the marbles repo:

```bash
cd config
curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/hyperledger-on-kubernetes/master/workshop-remote-peer/marbles/connection_profile_eks.json -o connection_profile_eks.json
curl  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aws-samples/hyperledger-on-kubernetes/master/workshop-remote-peer/marbles/marbles_eks.json -o marbles_eks.json
```

Still in the config directory, edit `connection_profile_eks.json`:

* Do a global search & replace on 'michaelpeer', replacing it with your peer name
* In the 'replace' commands below, make sure you do not change the port number, nor remove the protocol (e.g. grpc://)
* Replace the orderer URL with the NLB endpoint provided by your facilitator (The same one you used in Step 10. See the 
statement 'export ORDERER_CONN_ARGS='). If the facilitator has already updated this in the README, the address below
should be correct:

```json
    "orderers": {
        "orderer3-org0.org0": {
            "url": "grpc://ae1c0be5ee31111e8bc5e06d80436fb8-e2d2261530926342.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:7050",
```

* Replace the peer URL (both url and eventUrl) with the endpoint you obtained in Step 11 when 
running `kubectl describe svc <your peer service name> -n org1` 

```json
    "peers": {
        "michaelpeer1-org1.org1": {
            "url": "grpc://a55e52d7d93c511e8a5200a2330c2ef3-25d11c6db68acd98.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:7051",
            "eventUrl": "grpc://a55e52d7d93c511e8a5200a2330c2ef3-25d11c6db68acd98.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:7052",
```

* Replace the certificateAuthorities URL with the endpoint you obtained in Step 11 when 
running `kubectl describe svc <your CA service name> -n org1` 

```json
    "certificateAuthorities": {
        "ica-org1": {
            "url": "http://a4572233e93c511e8a5200a2330c2ef3-6cd15c4b453d4003.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:7054",
```

* Replace the name of the marbles chaincode

```json
            "chaincodes": [
                "marbles-workshop:v1"
            ],
```

One final change will ensure our new connection profile is used:

* In the marbles repo, edit the file `gulpfile.js`
* Around line 40, add this line:

```json
gulp.task('marbles_eks', ['env_eks', 'watch-sass', 'watch-server', 'server']);		//run with command `gulp marbles_eks` for AWS EKS container service
```

* Around line 50, add this section:

```json
gulp.task('env_eks', function () {
	env['creds_filename'] = 'marbles_eks.json';
});
```

### Step 13: Running and using the marbles application
You can run the Marbles application either on your laptop or on your Cloud9 instance.

#### Running Marbles on your laptop
NOTE: Marbles running locally cannot connect to the ELB port 7054 if you are running your VPN software. Please
stop the VPN before connecting.

On your laptop, in the marbles repo directory (not the config directory, which you may be in), in the root folder of 
the repo, run the following:

```bash
gulp marbles_eks
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
debug: Detected that we have launched successfully before
debug: Welcome back - Marbles is ready
debug: Open your browser to http://localhost:32001 and login as "admin"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```

If this fails, ensure your VPN is not running.

In a browser, navigate to: http://localhost:32001/home. You should see the Marbles UI.

#### Running Marbles on Cloud9
NOTE: Marbles will run on Cloud9, but if you use the default port you won't be able to connect to the Marbles application.
Do the following to fix this:

In the `marbles` directory:

```bash
vi config/marbles_eks.json 
```

Change this line as follows:

```bash
"port": 32001
```

to

```bash
"port": 8080
```

In Cloud9, in the marbles repo directory (not the config directory, which you may be in), in the root folder of 
the repo, run the following:

```bash
gulp marbles_eks
```

You should see something similar to this:

```bash
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
debug: Detected that we have launched successfully before
debug: Welcome back - Marbles is ready
debug: Open your browser to http://localhost:8080 and login as "admin"
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
```

Note: you may need to reduce the size of your terminal window to access the Cloud9 menu.

At the top of your Cloud9 page you'll see a menu with the option `AWS Cloud9` at the top left. Top right you will
see a link titled `Preview`. Select this, then select `Preview Running Application`. This will open the Marbles UI
in a browser window within the Cloud9 page. You can also open this in a browser. In the Cloud9 browser window, on the
right hand side next to the URL box, there is a square with an arrow. Clicking this will open the page in your 
default browser.

#### Running Marbles
After completing one of the steps above, continue with the following steps in the Marbles UI.

* Click 'Settings' and set Story Mode ON. This will show you what Fabric is doing behind the scenes when you create
new marbles or transfer them.
* Click the magnifying glass on the left, then click on a marble to see the transactions related to that marble. 

Now go ahead and drag marbles from one owner to another, or create new marbles. Watch how the UI explains what is
happening inside Fabric. For further 'geek-level' detail, check out the terminal window where you started the marbles
app. You'll see debug statements showing the transactions being sent by the client application to the Fabric network.

Add yourself as a new marble owner. Now, for some reason, the developers of the app created a chaincode function
to do this, but did not include this function in the UI. So we'll do it the hard way.

On your EC2 bastion instance, do the following:
* 'exec' into the register container
* enter the export statements you used in Step 6 (replicated below for convenience):

```bash
export CORE_PEER_TLS_ENABLED=false
export CORE_PEER_TLS_CLIENTAUTHREQUIRED=false
export CORE_PEER_CHAINCODELISTENADDRESS=0.0.0.0:7052
export CORE_PEER_ID=michaelpeer1-org1
export CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=michaelpeer1-org1.org1:7051
export CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=org1MSP
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/data/orgs/org1/admin/msp
```
* identify yourself as a user by executing the command below:

```bash
export CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/etc/hyperledger/fabric/orgs/org1/user/msp
```

Execute the chaincode below to add yourself as a marble owner. Change the numbers below to some other random number (i.e. 
o9999999999999999990 and m999999999990 - just make sure you have the same or fewer digits), and change 'bob' to your 
alias (something unique). MAKE SURE you use both the 'o' and 'm' prefixes in your owner and marble names. The marbles 
app depends on them. 

If you execute both invoke statements immediately after each other, the second one will probably fail. Any idea why? 
If you have Story Mode ON, as suggested above, and you watch what happens in Fabric when you transfer a marble, it will 
give you a strong hint.

You may need to wait a few seconds between the invoke statements, and for your new owner to be reflected in the query.
There is no issue with running these statements multiple times.

```bash
export ORDERER_CONN_ARGS="-o ae1c0be5ee31111e8bc5e06d80436fb8-e2d2261530926342.elb.us-west-2.amazonaws.com:7050"
peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["init_owner","o9999999988899999990","bob", "United Marbles"]}' $ORDERER_CONN_ARGS
peer chaincode invoke -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["init_marble","m999988899990", "blue", "35", "o9999999988899999990", "United Marbles"]}' $ORDERER_CONN_ARGS
peer chaincode query -C mychannel -n marbles-workshop -c '{"Args":["read_everything"]}'
```

Now jump back to the UI and you should automatically see these changes to the blockchain state reflected in the app. You can
now add new marbles via the UI (or via the CLI) and transfer marbles to/from other participants.

### Step 14: Pat yourself on the back

Well done for making it this far. Let's look at what you've achieved:

* You have built a Kubernetes cluster
* On this cluster, you have deployed a Hyperledger Fabric CA and Peer, which connects into an existing Hyperledger Fabric network
* You have joined your peer to an existing channel
* You have replicated all the blocks from the existing Fabric channel to your peer, and your peer has used these blocks to
build its own copy of the ledger and world state
* You have run a UI application, connected this to your local Fabric peer, and invoked transactions on the Fabric network
via the local app and your local peer

Quite impressive!

### Step 15: Cleanup

Cleanup your Hyperledger Fabric nodes:

```bash
./workshop-remote-peer/stop-remote-fabric-setup.sh
```

If you do not run the statement above, you may still have load balancers in your AWS account. Use the EC2 console to
find the NLBs or ELBs created for use by Hyperledger, and delete them. You'll also need to delete the associated
Target Groups, which can also be found in the EC2 console.

Delete the ec2-cmd-client CloudFormation stack, to remove your EFS and bastion EC2 instance.

Don't forget to remove your EKS cluster. Instructions can be found here:

* eksctl: eksctl delete cluster --name=<CLUSTER_NAME>
* EKS: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/delete-cluster.html
* Kops: https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/blob/master/docs/cli/kops_delete_cluster.md

If eksctl cannot delete your EKS cluster, do the following:

* Delete the CloudFormation stacks: eksctl-eks-fabric-nodegroup-0, eksctl-eks-fabric-cluster (could differ depending on your EKS cluster name)
* Delete the EKS cluster in the EKS console. This should be deleted by the CloudFormation stacks above, but best to double check.
* Delete the keypair PEM file. In your Cloud9 instance, in your home directory, delete the file eks-c9-keypair.pem

In the Cloud9 console, delete your Cloud9 instance. This will delete the corresponding CloudFormation stack for your Cloud9 instance. 
If it doesn't, you can delete the Cloud9 stack manually.

Delete the EC2 keypair you created. It will be in the EC2 console, under Key Pairs

### Debugging Fabric on Kubernetes

To debug Fabric running in Kubernetes, there are a few commands that will come in handy.

To see all pods running your Kubernetes cluster:

```bash
kubectl get po --all-namespaces
```

To see the pods running in a specific Kubernetes namespace, in this case 'org1':

```bash
kubectl get po -n org1
```

To see the logs for a specific pod, using the pod name from 'get po'. Do this first:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod name> -n org1
```

It may error, asking for a container name. It will then provide you with a list of the container names. Rerun the 
statement with a container name:

```bash
kubectl logs <pod name> -n org1 -c peer1-org1
```

To describe a pod and see its associated details:

```bash
kubectl describe po <pod name> -n org1
```

### Debugging marbles errors
If you see something like the error below, it could be that marbles is using a previously cached identity:

```bash
error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal - Promise is rejected: Error: 2 UNKNOWN: access denied: channel [mychannel] creator org [org1MSP]
    at new createStatusError (/home/ec2-user/marbles/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:64:15)
    at /home/ec2-user/marbles/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:590:15
```

You can remove the cached identities as follows:

```bash
ls /home/ec2-user/.hfc-key-store
rm -rf /home/ec2-user/.hfc-key-store
```
